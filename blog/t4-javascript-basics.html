    <h4>Javascript Basics</h4>
      <p><strong>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</strong></p>
      <p>If HTML is an empty glove, and CSS is the colour, design and fabric of the glove, 'JAVASCRIPT' is the hand that goes 'Inside' the glove and makes it move and do things. The hand (or Javascript, can perform actions, tasks and can respond to interactions with users.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up,' or 'brushing your teeth.'
      </strong></p> 
      <p>Control flow and loops can be likened to tasks in our everyday lives. Control flow refers to the flow of actions or tasks, this flow can be manipulated. For example: If you are hungry, go to kitchen and get something to eat. If there is bread make sandwich, otherwise(else) search for alternative to sandwich. Loops can be likened to brushing teeth. While (keep doing this action until it no longer is true) teeth are dirty, brush teeth. If teeth are finally clean, stop brushing.</p>
      <p><strong>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals</strong></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Accessing data from arrays is done using the index of the item you're after. Data from object literals comes in key => value pairs, and can be accessed by terms and keywords.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</strong></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. It can be likened to a play or 'call' in your sports team. Let's say the function (or call) is 'diamond.' And the play Diamond has been designed (at trainings before the game) to perform a task that 'all players form a diamond on offense' to position the team to score. Like plays and calls in sport, a function needs to be called in order to invoke or 'start' the function. Likewise with sport calls, someone needs to call or yell out the play so that the play is actioned. Hope that makes sense.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why?</strong></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Well I was pressed for time, so I left out social media button links. Got rid of a blog button and a few other changes. Sometimes it's alot easier designing what you want something to look like, but then actually getting something to 'look' and work how you want it to is a whole nother story.</p>
