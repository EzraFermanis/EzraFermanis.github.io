      <p><strong>How does life look through the "Pleasure, Passion and Purpose" lens?</strong></p>
      <p>Life through the Pleasure lens, happiness comes in short bursts. This is sadly the form of happiness that most people seek. It is 
      the kind of happiness that is unsustainable. Passion is more sustainable then Pleasure as a form of happiness, and is often called 'the flow.' It's when you get satisfaction from the job, and time just flies by. You get lost in your work, so much to the point where it becomes your only focus and you gain satisfactoin from completing it. The final form of happiness - Purpose, is the most sustainable form of happiness. It's the form we should all be striving for. It's when Happiness comes from knowing that what you are doing is bigger then yourself. It's knowing that you are making a difference, and you love where you are in life, work, and your inner self.</p>

      <p><strong>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose exercise, what are your core values? </p></strong>
      <p>My Core Values are probably Kindness, Friendship, Goodwill, and Assistance. I like to help others, I get along with anyone and everyone. I'm friendly and kind, and like to look for ways to help and assist others. </p>    

      <p><strong>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose exercise, what do you stand for? </p></strong>
      <p>I stand for Freedom, Fairness, Justice, Goodwill to all, Equality, and Peace. I just want the best for the world and everyone and thing on it. </p>    

      <p><strong>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</p></strong>
      <p>I found the exercise and ideas very helpful. I've really gotten into meditating, especially with the headspace app that we were introduced to. I've managed to do it every morning and I find it wakes me up and prepares me for the new day.</p>    

      <p><strong>Any other musings?</p></strong>
      <p>A good chapter, and really enjoying 'Search Inside Yourself.' Ideas, studies and information from the book are things you never really think about. You often take all these things for granted and don't ever question what drives you, or why you are the way you are. This book is very enlightening. </p>
