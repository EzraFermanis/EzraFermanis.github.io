    <h4>HTML, CSS and DOM - Part 1</h4>

      <p><strong>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to a non-technical friend?</strong></p>
      <p>I think a good anology to use for the HTML,CSS and the Dom is the Human body. We have HTML - which is the structure or BONES of the website. The CSS is the body, Skin or 'Looks' of the website. The DOM I guess could be an Xray print out perhaps that doesn't show all 'everything in the body, but shows the key scan of the most of the Bones or 'HTML.'</p>

      <p><strong>What is meant by boxifying a design?</strong></p> 
      <p>Boxifying a design is when you take a design, and draw or cut out or mark out key pieces of the design. You'er essentially breaking the design into workable blocks - as everything on a website is rectangular or square.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>What is the Box Model?</strong></p>
      <p>The Box Model is a model which shows the makeup of an object or a piece of content on a website. The model essentially shows 4 boxes, 1 inside the other. The inner most box is the content. The next box surrounding the content is the padding. Outside the padding we have the border. And finally, outside the border we have the margin. It's a great model to visually show the spacing surrounding an object, and it's a great feature of the DOM.</p>
