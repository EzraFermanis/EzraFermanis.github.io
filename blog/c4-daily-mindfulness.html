    <h4>Daily Mindfulness</h4>
      <p><strong>What did you learn from the Mindfulness conversation? How did the other find it?</strong></p>
      <p>I found the mindfulness conversation really really fulfilling. It lets you vent (so to speak) about what went on in your day and really felt like a good way to unload. It was also a good way to see what was on my Wifes' mind. She absolutely loved it and suggested we make it a daily thing every night.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use for practice?
      </strong></p> 
      <p>I think that it's beyond my control now. The Wife has spoken, and apparently it's now a daily practice in our household. I would like to also do the Walking meditation and be mindful of every step, breath, movement etc that I do, just because it's something that I can do myself.</p>
      <p><strong>Other Musings</strong></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A great chapter, with very insighful ideas on ways to increase mindfulness. Is something I can definitely improve on as I find myself easily distracted at times.</p>
