    <h4>Leadership</h4>
      <p><strong>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) Leadership?</strong></p>
      <p>I have had to manage staff on multiple occasions. Some of those staff were family members - brothers, so I found it hard to manage them without getting frustrated. I noticed on both cases (both when I managed non-family members and family members) that using compassion worked far more effectively than getting angry and demanding action.</p>

      <p><strong>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</p></strong> </p>
      <p>To be honest, when I was reading it at first, I had a bit of a chuckle with myself. haha it sounds pretty cheesey. But after completing the exercise, I must admit, despite the initial doubt, I did actually feel alot happier. </p>

      <p><strong>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</p></strong>
      <p>This meditation exercise I found to be more of a reassuritive and relieving mediatation. I felt at peace afterwards. I'm not sure whether that was the goal of it but it's what I felt.</p>

      <p><strong>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase-0 experience so far? How will it apply at bootcamp?</p></strong>
      <p>The Scarf model has applied in my Phase 0 study, because all the features of the model resonate with me. I was unsure of everthing and everyone going into Dev study. But I feel alot better, communicating with everyone, and with my purpose in the whole study. I also feel it will apply in bootcamp because I will have to step outside my comfort zone, and meet people I'm not familiar with, face challenges, push my limits etc. And I'm excited about it all.

      <p><strong>I had a difficult conversation with my family member. We had differences throughout but so long as you can bring the conversation to a close positively, everything that happens in the conversation winds up being fine - even though it may get heated.</p></strong>
      <p>Pretty good exercises this week. Great book so far.</p>
