<p><strong>What is Grid Based Design?</strong></p>
<p>Grid based design is the method of breaking down a design into a grid, and building a website based on the grid best suited for that particular design. The most common grid column number is 12 because it allows for greater customisation.</p>

<p><strong>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</strong></p> 
<p>The hype about responsive webpages is there and so prominent because devices are now so widely available and they come in all different shapes and sizes. The popularity of handheld devices over desktops is also increasing so building responsive web pages is hugely important in capturing the handheld device audience, and making it a pleasant experience for them or whoever browses your website regardless of the device used. Response webpages creat a more pleasant user experience and allow for greater accessibility of your site.</p>

<p><strong>Semantic Structure</strong></p>
<p>Semantic Structure is the semantic tags and the order that you label and define your code/content. Applying semantic structure tags to your code for example (h1-h5) gives order and importance to different elements and content on your page. Improves the overall layout and clarity of a website. </p>

<p><strong>Other Points</strong></p>
<p>I just found it interesting how there are just SO MANY tools out there to use as web developers. Take for example the placeholder page that was shown in the lesson. I was like that's interesting. Then he brings up the dog placeholder website, and then the kitten placeholder website. It's just mind boggling how many useful sites there are on the WEB. I think the hardest thing is deciding which tools to use.</p>
