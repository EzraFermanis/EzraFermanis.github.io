      <p><strong>What learnings did you take from the Chapter?</strong></p>
      <p>I felt like this chapter really hit home for me. I find myself letting my emotions get the better of me. I like the analogy at the start of the chapter about the horse, and likening that to our emotions and us being the rider - we can either let our emotions (the horse) take us places or we can guide our emotions. Great analogy. I learned about the Siberian North Railroad technique (which I will probably use. If I get stressed at work or home or with study I'll make sure I try the - stop, breathe, notice, reflect, respond steps of the technique. Also avoiding the triggers in the first place can be a benefitial course of action however this is circumstantial as there are times and places where one should experience emotion of the time e.g. sympathising with others.</p>

      <p><strong>How did you find the 2 minutes of Mindfulness</p></strong>
      <p>The 2 minutes of Mindfulness was great. It gave me time to listen and experience and step away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. You feel alot calmer after just taking 2 mins to think about nothing (or the small things).</p>      <p></p>
