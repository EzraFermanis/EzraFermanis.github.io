    <h4>Problem Solving</h4>
      <p><strong>Tell your non-tech friend how you:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>1. Got blocked on a simple problem.</strong></p>
      <br>
      <p>What was the problem?<p>
      <p>Well I was stuck on a function exercise for ages, thinking that there was a problem with the code syntax. Turns out I just forgot to close the function with a }. Something so small you can just forget so easilly.</p>
      <br>
      <p>What problem solving technique did you use?</p>
      <p>I used the 'reading error messages' technique.</p>
      <br>
      <p>How did you feel throughout the process?</p>
      <p>I felt frustrated and confused. But also relieved when I finally found the error.
      <br>
      <p>What did you learn?</p>
      <p>I learnt that I should run my code through a lint tool OR just read the darn error messages from the get-go.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>2. Solved a problem in an elegant way</strong></p>
      <br>
      <p>What was the problem?<p>
      <p>The whole map exercises on the camp code site</p>
      <br>
      <p>What problem solving technique did you use?</p>
      <p>I used the googling problem solving technique</p>
      <br>
      <p>How did you feel throughout the process?</p>
      <p>I felt confident as I was flying through the exercises and understood everything clearly.
      <br>
      <p>What did you learn?</p>
      <p>I learnt that google knows everything.</p>

 
      <p><strong>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:
      </strong></p> 

       <p>Psuedocode:  I don't feel that confident with psuedocode simply because I haven't been in a position where I've had the time to use this. It's not hard, as it's just breaking down your problem into plain english, but when you're pushed for time it's something you see as a 'convenience'. I can see how it is effective, especially when the code begins to get longer and more complex.<p>
       <p>Trying something: I'm king at 'trying something'. I like trial and error by nature so this way works well for me<p>
       <p>Rubber ducky method: I don't own a rubber ducky. I might try this and just replace the duck with something I have</p>
       <p>Reading error messages: This proved effective in solving a few of my issues. Will keep using this.</p>
       <p>Console.logging: Don't really use.</p>
       <p>Googling: This I use the most. Simply because Google knows everything.</p>
       <p>Asking your peers for help: I need to work more on this. The only issues is the I want answers right away.</p>
       <p>Asking coaches for help: Same answer as above</p>
       <p>Improving your process with reflection: will try and work on. </p>

      <p><strong>Using the JS Array docs as a starting point, describe what these functions do in your own words:</strong></p>
      <p>.map() = .map iterates through each element in an array. </p>
     <p>.filter() = .filter can filter out values that you input into the function</p>
     <p>.reduce() = .reduce merges 2 arrays into 1 </p>
      <p></p>

      <p><strong>Have a go at explaining how recursion compares to iteration (In your own words)</strong></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Recursion takes longer then iteration and uses more memory. But recursion is more readible and easier to understand and maintain in the long run. Recursion runs the risk of 'call stack overflow' which is when there is too many stacks of data - though this is often unlikely. Recursion is seen as the more elegant approach. Iteration is alot quicker and simpler to write.</p>
