    <h4>Scope</h4>
    <h5>Explain to a non-tech friend:</h5>
    <br>
      <p><strong>What 'Scope' is and how it works in Javascript</strong></p>
      <p>Scope in Javascript refers to what a variable can see and access within the document. There are 2 types of variable scope in javascript: 1) Global Scope, and 2) Local Scope. Global scope is a variable declared outside of a function. It can be accessed throughout the whole document and it's value can be adjusted at any time. A local variable, is a variable declared within a function. It's scope is only within that function. Everytime that function is recalled or invoked, the variable is re-created every time. </p>
