    <h4>Emotional Intelligence</h4>

      <p><strong>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</strong></p>
      <p>I learnt alot from the chapter I read. I didn't realise Emotional Intelligence was so important. I knew what it was, as I work with Engineers and have noticed alot of their E.Q skills aren't the greatest. But I didn't know that it was something you could train. I thought either you had it or you didn't. I also had the perception that you are either a happy person, angry person or normal person.I considered it part of the person and I must say I'm sure that majority of people look this way on people. I know people that are always grumpy, and angry all the time. Because they are always angry, it impacts how I view them as a person. This books explains how we can train our feelings, thoughts, mindfullness and more. I learnt also from the chapter, the benefits of a greater Emotional Intelligence. They are excellent leadership skills, success at work, and overall happiness.</p>

      <p><strong>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</strong></p> 
      <p>The 2 minutes of mindfullness was good. I have been using headspace, the meditation app for a while now, so I have got the feel for mediation now. 2 minutes, though not long, seems quite long when there is no voice or background sound. 2 minutes of silent sitting and 'just being' is great. I felt clearer afterwards and more focussed.</p>
