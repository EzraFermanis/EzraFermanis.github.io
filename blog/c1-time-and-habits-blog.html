    <h4>Time and Habits</h4>

      <p><strong>which timebox and habits techniques did you try</strong></p>
<p>I tried the Pomodoro technique, meditation and time box.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>what did you find interesting?</strong></p> 
<p>I found the meditation technique very interesting. I didn't realise meditation had so many prodound benefits to the mind and body. It's often overlooked or sometimes even mocked in culture today when someone is meditating. I've downloaded the app and will give it a go!</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>what worked for you?</strong></p>
<p>Pomodoro technique works for me. I use it at work as well and it's really effective to ensure you remain focused and productive</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>which will you experiment further with?</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned above, I'm really going to give meditation a decent go. I've downloaded the meditation app and will see how it works for me.</p>
