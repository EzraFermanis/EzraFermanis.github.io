      <p><strong>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</strong></p>
      <p>I have, especially at work. When my colleague says they've have done a certain task, instead of checking that that person has done that task, I trust them and thank them for doing it. It requires quite a lot of trust really, because usally if my colleague hasn't done the task that they said they did, it will affect all that I do beyond that point.</p>

      <p><strong>Try Empathic Listening - how did it go?</p></strong> </p>
      <p>I tried this with my wife. It went down well. It was a little weird at first, as she couldn't take me seriously, but after she started to get into, she really did enjoy the session, and I did too. I sort've felt what she felt for a brief moment of time. </p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</p></strong>
      <p>I tried the Loving Kindness practice where you read the script about how people are so like you, and how they want everything that you want, and essentially to be happy. I found that this exercise worked really really well. Too often, we look at life through our own eyes, and never stop to think about what the other person or people in our life are going through. Be it your mum, wife, dad, friend, anyone - this exercise is great at enabling you to consider their feelings and wellbeing.</p>

      <p><strong>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing</p></strong>
      <p>1) A disagreement I had in the past was at my previous job. I had been working for them for 3 years but hadn't been given a formal written contract. </p>
      <p> I felt I needed and deserved one and should not be held on as a part-time 'on-call' employee when I was working full-time. I worked hard for them, and was a great worker and felt it was the very least that they could do. </p>
      <p> We were correct and justified in keeping Ezra as a part-time employee because we weren't committed to hiring more 'permanent' staff. We do appreciate his work but we simply don't have solid work to commit him as a full time employee. (This is what they probably would've said though the truthfullness of said comments is questionable.)

      <p><strong>Any other musings?</p></strong>
      <p>Pretty good exercises this week. Great book so far.</p>
