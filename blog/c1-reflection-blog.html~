    <h3>Sprint 1</h3>
    


    <p>What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?</p>
<p>My take on EDA experience so far is that it really is 'self driven.' You will only get as much as you put in. The teachers and aids and resources are all there but you will only learn if you devote the time and effort towards the programme. It's like the saying 'you can lead a horse to water, but you can't force it to drink.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>What are your impressions?</p>
<p>First impressions are really positive. Shareef mentions that we need to eliminate the self doubt, or negative thoughts when coming into bootcamp, I must admit I get these doubts and thoughts run through my head every now and then. Thoughts like 'you won't be cut out for this type of stuff.' I even get it from my boss occassionally, who knows I'm doing this phase 0. She will often say - 'I just don't see you as a Web developer.' I think she only says that because I'm good with people. But I see myself as the potential to be one. I've been in the previous couple of phase 0 cohorts where the curriculem was focussed more on Ruby. Now with the focus being javascript, and the introduction of new applications to use during phase 0 like Virtual machine, waffle, and toggl, I find myself alot more in control of where I am in the sprints. I can visually see the tasks I need to do and what I need to work on. I can also keep track with toggl to see how much time I'm devoting each week to my studies. It's still only week 1 though so will see how it all goes. 
<p></p>
<p>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
<p>I see myself working well in this culture. I have no issues working with people and I do enjoy challenges. I also am not afraid to work late and I have a feeling during bootcamp that will be the case but I'm up for it. I need to remind myself as Shareef mentioned, to not treat bootcamp like a product and 'be a consumer' but treat dev bootcamp as more of an experience where I can either make the most of, or just roll with it. I really hope to make the most of the 9 weeks.</p> 
<p></p>
<p>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</p>
<p>My expectations of EDA haven't changed. But after watching Shareefs video, the purpose and goal of the program has been clarified in my mind.
<p></p>
<p>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</p>
<p>Yes I am REALLY excited about Dev bootcamp and the learning environment. I really hope to move into an apartment in town for bootcamp so that it's not a hassle coming into the bootcamp office every night and gives me the option of working late with no issues about worrying how I'm getting home or where to park etc. I'm excited but I must admit a little nervous, because I know 9 weeks is going to go so fast!!</p>
