    <h4>Meditation Process</h4>
      <p><strong>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</strong></p>
      <p>It affected the way I did my site redesign but allowing me to not stress about how my site wasn't looking perfect. It made me appreciate how much I've learnt in the 'process' of redesiging my product/website, and not focus on the flaws of the end product. Because I have learnt ALOT after all the redesign.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>What did you think about mediation before reading chapter 2?</strong></p> 
      <p>I thought Mediation was sitting in one place with crossed legs and holding your hands up and humming. And I imagined monks too when I used to think of mediation.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>What new things have you learnt about mediation?</strong></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>It's for anyone and everyone. It has so many benefits.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</strong></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Posture. I really need to work on that, as sometimes I get a sore back. A good posture as mentioned in the book can go a long way. So that's something I need to work on especially when I'm sitting.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>Any other musings?</strong></p>
