    <h4>Self Confidence</h4>
      <p><strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness?</strong></p>
      <p>The relationship between the 2 is that they're both very similar and go hand in hand. Self-awareness and mindfullness are both trainable.

      <p><strong>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</strong></p> 
      <p>I've found a great app called 'Journey'. It's a great journal app and I think this will help me get into a good habit of writing in my journal (which i've never really ever been in the habit of doing). Hopefully this jornal app can help me make a habit of this. My experience of it is only positive. It gives me a time to reflect on what I've done during the day, as well as how I'm feeling and my experiences throughout the day.</p>
      <p><strong>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not me" section?</strong></p>
      <p>A great section. I do need to remember this section, because it not only affects the way I see myself, but also the way I see others. For example, I know someone who is always angry, so that's who I pereive them as a person, when really, I should be just saying to myself that he/she is only 'feeling' angry. He is not an angry person. The section teaches us that emotions are a state of mind, and are physiological feelings that can be controlled, like pain etc. When we look at it this way it's much easier to maintain and control our emotions, instead of letting our emotions control us.<p>
