    <h2>Welcome to my blog </h2>
    <h3>2015</h3>
    
    <p>
      This blog will be a regular insight into my doings and my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blogs are a great way to jot down your thoughts and feelings (much like a journal). It's also a great way to inform others about myself and my life.

    <p>
      I hope you enjoy my blog.
